# Storybook-Vis

To use my visualization: Select a story to compare from each of the two drop downs. Then the pie charts compare words in the story that a kindergartner should know, compared to the rest of the words in that story. The bar chart shows the word counts of each story compared to the average length of a short story a kindergartner can read.

This was made using HTML, CSS Bootstrap, Javascript, D3.js, and Python
