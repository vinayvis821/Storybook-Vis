    <h1>Vinay's Process Book</h1>
    <h2>Part 1: Design</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What do you want to achieve with the visualization?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For my visualization I want to tailor it to explicate information that
          will be helpful when looking to find books that are correct for the
          reading age of kindergartners.
        </li>
        <li>
          We all know these folk tales and short stories were made as bed time
          and tall tales to appease the minds of small children. However, I want
          to delve deeper into that sentiment and uncover how tailored a few of
          the most common stories are.
        </li>
        <li>
          After doing some research on average amount and what types of words a
          kindergartner should know, I want to look at how many words go beyond
          the scope of those 50-100 some words. I want to achieve the act of
          deciding if these books are kid friendly or not.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        What tasks do I want to support?
        <ul>
          <li>
            Firstly, I want to support the task of checking the percantage of
            words in each story and how it compares to the list of words the
            average kindergarter should know.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secondly, I want to compare the total word count of each of the
            short stories to the average length a kids story should be, to see
            if each story is beyond the scope of what an average kindergartner
            can understand and enjoy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lastly, I want to support the task of making these visualizations
            beautiful with vibrant colors and a design that is pleasing to the
            eye.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        What designs will help me accomplish these?
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first design that will help is a pie chart. I know that there is
            some controversy with these types of charts that we have discussed
            in class, but I believe it will be helpful in determining the
            percentage of words that a kindergartner should know compared to the
            other words in each story.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second design that will help is using a bar chart. This bar
            chart will compare the total word count of the short story to the
            average length of a story a child of that age should be reading.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part 2: Sketches</h2>
    <h3>Sketch 1</h3>
    <img src="images/sketch1.png" alt="sketch 1" width="800" />
    <p>
      My sketches are rather rudimentary. however, they showcase exactly what I
      want to explicate in my final design. In this design, I allow the reader
      to choose a story from a drop down menu, then I have a pie chart showing
      the percentage of words are commonly known by children. The chart to the
      right is a bar chart showing the word count for that story compared to the
      average word count of a story a child should be able to read. This is
      helpful in determining if a particular short story is right for your
      child.
    </p>
    <h3>Sketch 2</h3>
    <img src="images/sketch2.png" alt="sketch 2" width="800" />
    <p>
      My sketches are rather rudimentary. however, they showcase exactly what I
      want to explicate in my final design. In this design, I allow the reader
      to choose two stories from drop down menus to compare their reading
      difficulty. I have two pie chart respectively showing the percentage of
      words are commonly known by children for each story. The chart to the
      middle is a bar chart showing the word count for each story compared to
      the average word count of a story a child should be able to read. This is
      helpful in determining a comparison between the two selected stories.
    </p>
    <h2>Part 3: My Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first thing I wanted to do was parse and process the text files. I
        knew I only wanted to support a few short stories rather than all of
        them so I landed on a few of the ones that I knew and that were the most
        commononly known.
      </li>
      <li>
        I created seperate text files for each story I wanted to use. Then, by
        using a python script to read in the file, I was able to create a new
        file with the list of all the words in the file in an array like format
        that can be understood by javascript.
      </li>
      <li>
        I created a new javascript file that contains 6 arrays, with each array
        being the list of all words in that story.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then the first I did was create the UI and design the interface. I made
        it simple and modern so that it was visually appealing and the colors
        were not too jarring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then it was time to create the class structure. I followed the previous
        guidelines and created a class based designs for the pie and bar chart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, after hooking up event listeners, I was able to display the data
        using a pie chart and a bar chart accordingly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Part 4: Justification for final design</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        These stories are made for kids, so knowing which story might be easier
        for them to read and to understand is helpful for parents choosing which
        story to read to their kid
      </li>
      <li>
        I ended up going with my second sketch because I watned to explain and
        compare multiple stories together
      </li>
      <li>
        The colors are very warm and inviting. They are not jarring to the eye
        which is why I chose them.
      </li>
      <li>
        The UI is very clean and simple and is very visually appealing, so that
        is why it looks the way it does
      </li>
      <li>
        I chose a pie chart to easily visualize percentage values, and the
        colors in the chart represent green for known words, and red for unknown
        words
      </li>
      <li>
        The colors for the bar chart are green for less than average, red for
        more than average, and orange for average
      </li>
      <li>
        While simple, I believe that my design is very clean and is beautiful to
        the eye. The only thing I wish I had more time to add was transitions
        between the movement of the charts
      </li>
    </ul>
